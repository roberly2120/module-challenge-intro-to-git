## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is a Version Control System. It allows for creating code locally before pushing it to an online location for review and approval for use.

Git is where code is created or edited locally on a computer while GitHub is a place where that code is stored online. 
3. Why do we create a branch?
We create a branch to fix bugs, edit, or add on to existing code separately from the main branch so that in case a mistake is made it can be reviewed before being added to the main.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
A pull request lets your team/lead know that you have made changes to code that need to be reviewed.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout -b
